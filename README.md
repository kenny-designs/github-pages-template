# github-pages-template
To create a new GitHub Pages static site, first click on settings. After that, scroll all the way down to the GitHub Pages section.
From there, choose the master branch, or whatever branch you want to have the files served from, as your source. You will then see a
green check mark if all is well. Click that to be taken to your site. Note, if it isn't working try putting the name of your main
html file at the end of the URL.

My site is here: https://kenny-designs.github.io/github-pages-template/index.html
